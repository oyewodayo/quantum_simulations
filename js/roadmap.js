    options: ['Qubits can hold a superposition of 0 and 1 at once', 'Qubits are just faster bits', 'Qubits can only be measured once, ever', 'There is no real difference'],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: 'A qubit\'s amplitudes let it genuinely be a mix of both basis states until measured — a classical bit never has that option.' },
  { lessonId: 'maths-complex',
    q: 'Why do qubit amplitudes need to be complex numbers rather than just real numbers?',
    options: ['Complex numbers are more precise than real numbers', 'The extra phase in a complex number is what makes interference between paths possible', 'Real numbers can\'t be negative', 'It\'s just a mathematical convention with no physical meaning'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Two real amplitudes could still cancel by sign, but only a complex phase lets amplitudes reinforce or cancel at any relative angle — that richer freedom is exactly what interference exploits.' },
  { lessonId: 'maths-vectors',
    q: 'What does the normalization condition |α|² + |β|² = 1 guarantee about a qubit state?',
    options: ['That the qubit is entangled', 'That the total measurement probability across |0⟩ and |1⟩ adds up to exactly 100%', 'That the qubit has been measured', 'That α and β are both real numbers'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'P(0) + P(1) = |α|² + |β|² must equal 1 for the Born rule to make sense as a probability distribution — every valid point on the Bloch sphere already satisfies this automatically.' },
  { lessonId: 'maths-matrices',
    q: 'What property must every valid quantum gate matrix U satisfy?',
    options: ['det(U) = 0', 'U†U = I (U is unitary)', 'U must be a real-valued matrix', 'U must have exactly two rows'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Unitarity is what keeps the state vector normalized after the gate is applied — it\'s also exactly the condition that makes every quantum gate reversible, unlike a classical AND gate.' },
  { lessonId: 'maths-statevector',
    q: 'In the Bloch-sphere form |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^(iφ)sin(θ/2)|1⟩, what do θ and φ correspond to?',
    options: ['Two independent qubits', 'The exact same θ/φ sliders used to set a state on the Bloch sphere', 'The number of gates applied so far', 'The measurement outcome'],

    explanation: 'The tensor product of a 2-entry vector with another 2-entry vector always has 2×2 = 4 entries — one for each combination of basis outcomes, |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩ — regardless of what the actual amplitudes are.' },

  { lessonId: 'circuit',
    q: 'In a quantum circuit, why does the order of gates matter?',
    options: ['It doesn\'t — gates always commute', 'Each gate rotates the state, and rotations generally don\'t commute', 'Only the last gate has any effect', 'Order only matters for measurement'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Each gate is a rotation of the Bloch sphere, and 3D rotations don\'t generally commute — X then Z lands somewhere different than Z then X.' },
  { lessonId: 'bellstates',
    q: 'Φ⁺ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2 and Φ⁻ = (|00⟩ − |11⟩)/√2 are different states, yet measuring either one in this demo gives identical statistics. Why?',
    options: ['They are actually the same state written two ways', 'A relative phase (the − sign) doesn\'t change any computational-basis probability, only |amplitude|² does', 'The demo has a bug and can\'t tell them apart', 'Only Φ⁺ is a real Bell state'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Probabilities come from |amplitude|², which is identical for +1/√2 and −1/√2. The two states are still physically distinct — the phase becomes visible once the qubits are interfered with each other, e.g. by applying a Hadamard to each before measuring.' },
  { lessonId: 'measure',
    q: 'What happens to a qubit\'s superposition when you measure it?',
    options: ['Nothing changes', 'It collapses to a single definite outcome', 'It splits into two qubits', 'It becomes entangled automatically'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'There\'s no hidden fact about which outcome it "really" was beforehand — measuring is what produces a definite answer, weighted by the amplitudes.' },
  { lessonId: 'entangle',
    q: 'Two qubits are entangled. You measure the first and get |1⟩. What happens to the second?',
    options: ['Nothing — they are independent', 'Its outcome is now instantly correlated with the first, per their entangled state', 'It is destroyed', 'It becomes a classical bit'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Their amplitudes were linked the moment they became entangled — measuring one doesn\'t send a signal, it just reveals a correlation baked in from the start.' },
  { lessonId: 'tunnel',
    q: 'What is quantum tunneling?',
    options: ['A qubit teleporting instantly across space', 'A wave packet having nonzero probability of appearing beyond a classically-forbidden barrier', 'A gate that deletes a qubit', 'A measurement error'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'The wavefunction doesn\'t stop dead at a barrier — it decays exponentially inside it, so a thin enough barrier still leaves nonzero amplitude on the far side.' },
  { lessonId: 'interference',
    q: 'In the double-slit experiment, what causes the interference stripes on the screen?',
    options: ['Two separate particles colliding', 'Probability amplitudes from indistinguishable paths adding or canceling', 'The screen material', 'Measurement collapse happening early'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Each screen point has two possible paths; when they\'re indistinguishable their amplitudes add and can reinforce or cancel, producing the fringes.' },
  { lessonId: 'beamsplitter',
    q: 'A single photon hits a 50/50 beam splitter. What actually happens?',
    options: ['The photon splits in half, with half going to each detector', 'The photon goes to exactly one detector, chosen at random with 50/50 odds', 'Both detectors always click together', 'Neither detector clicks unless you measure twice'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'A photon is never divided between paths — the beam splitter puts it into a superposition of "reflected" and "transmitted", and measuring (the detector clicking) forces one definite outcome, same as measuring a qubit.' },
  { lessonId: 'sterngerlach',
    q: 'A beam of silver atoms passes through a Stern–Gerlach magnet. What does the experiment actually show on the detector screen?',
    options: ['A continuous smear from one extreme to the other', 'Exactly two discrete spots, never anything in between', 'A single spot in the exact center', 'No pattern at all — the atoms are absorbed'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Classically, a randomly-oriented magnetic dipole should deflect by any amount, producing a continuous smear. Stern and Gerlach found only two discrete spots — direct evidence that spin, like a qubit\'s own measurement outcomes, is quantized into just two possibilities along any axis.' },
  { lessonId: 'teleport',
    q: 'After Bob applies his correction gates, how does his qubit compare to Alice\'s original message?',
    options: ['It\'s a good approximation, close but not exact', 'It exactly matches — same amplitudes, same state', 'It\'s a classical copy, not a real quantum state', 'It only matches half the time'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Once the correct Z/X correction is applied, Bob\'s qubit equals Alice\'s original exactly, not approximately — that\'s the whole point of the protocol\'s classically-controlled correction step.' },
  { lessonId: 'superdense',
    q: 'In superdense coding, what actually has to physically travel from Alice to Bob?',
    options: ['Two classical bits, sent by radio or phone', 'A single qubit', 'Nothing — the entangled pair alone is enough', 'Four qubits, one per possible message'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Only Alice\'s one qubit ever travels. The entangled pair was shared in advance, and her message is encoded onto that single qubit before she sends it — that\'s what makes it "superdense": 2 bits of information from just 1 qubit of communication.' },
  { lessonId: 'noise',
    q: 'A qubit starts in a genuine superposition. After it fully decoheres (T₂ has elapsed many times over), what happens to its Bloch vector?',
    options: ['Nothing — decoherence only affects measurement, not the state', 'It shrinks toward the center, the same signature as a mixed/entangled state', 'It grows longer than 1', 'It instantly jumps to the south pole'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Losing coherence to the environment is mathematically identical to becoming entangled with something you can\'t track — both leave the qubit\'s own Bloch vector shorter than 1, a genuinely mixed state, not just a randomized pure one.' }
